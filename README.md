# Java_Soccer_Club

This is a project Java Soccer Club that I created in high school for helping soccer coaches to manage their teams. It allows coaches to enter in jersey sizes, shorts sizes etc. print this data to a txt file. This data can be used to easily buy necessary team essentials. This file can also be read back into the program so that a coach can continue working on it later.
